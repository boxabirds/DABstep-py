**ActionStep Overview:**

You are an expert assistant capable of solving tasks using code snippets. You will be given a task along with a set of tools—Python functions you can call with code. The resolution process involves a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.

1. **Thought:** Explain your reasoning regarding the task and the tools you will use.
   
2. **Code:** Write the necessary Python code, concluding with `<end_code>`. You can use `print()` to save crucial information for the next step. The output of these print statements will be available in the 'Observation:' for the subsequent step.

3. **Observation:** This section summarizes what you've observed from your 'Code:' execution, along with any outputs printed.

At the conclusion of your task, return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool.

**Example Tasks:**

1. **Task:** "Generate an image of the oldest person in this document."
   - **Thought:** Use `document_qa` to find the oldest person, then `image_generator` for the image.
   - **Code:**
     ```py
     answer = document_qa(document=document, question="Who is the oldest person mentioned?")
     print(answer)
     ```<end_code>
   - **Observation:** "The oldest person is John Doe, a 55-year-old lumberjack living in Newfoundland."
   - **Thought:** Generate an image.
   - **Code:**
     ```py
     image = image_generator("A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.")
     final_answer(image)
     ```<end_code>

2. **Task:** "What is the result of the operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?"
   - **Thought:** Use Python to compute the result.
   - **Code:**
     ```py
     result = 5 + 3 + 1294.678
     final_answer(result)
     ```<end_code>

3. **Task:** Answer a question about an image in French.
   - **Thought:** Use `translator` to translate the question and `image_qa` to answer.
   - **Code:**
     ```py
     translated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang="French", tgt_lang="English")
     print(f"The translated question is {translated_question}.")
     answer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)
     final_answer(f"The answer is {answer}")
     ```<end_code>

**General Task Guidelines:**

1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence and a 'Code:' sequence ending with '```<end_code>\'', or you will fail.
2. Use only variables you've defined.
3. When using tools, pass the arguments directly instead of as a dictionary.
4. Avoid chaining too many tool calls in the same code block.
5. Call a tool only when necessary, and avoid re-doing any tool calls with the same parameters.
6. Don't name variables after tools (e.g., don't name a variable `final_answer`).
7. Don't introduce notional variables that could confuse the real ones.
8. You can import from a specified list of Python modules.
9. The state persists between code executions.
10. Stay focused on solving the task; provide solutions rather than directions.

Now, let's begin the tasks! You can earn a reward upon successful completion.

**New Task:**

You are tasked to answer fact-based questions by referencing the files listed below. The available files are:
- `acquirer_countries.csv`
- `payments-readme.md`
- `payments.csv`
- `merchant_category_codes.csv`
- `fees.json`
- `merchant_data.json`
- `manual.md`

**Question:** What are the unique set of merchants in the payments data?

**Guidelines for answering:**
- Respond with a comma-separated list.

--- 

**Assistant's Step:**

**Thought:** To find the unique set of merchants in the payments data, I will first load the `payments.csv` file, which likely contains the merchant information. After loading the data, I will extract the unique merchant identifiers from it. I will check the documentation in `payments-readme.md` and `merchant_data.json` for better understanding.

**Code:**
```py
import pandas as pd

# Load the payments data
payments_df = pd.read_csv('DABstep-data/data/context/payments.csv')
print(payments_df.head())  # Check the first few rows of the data
```
